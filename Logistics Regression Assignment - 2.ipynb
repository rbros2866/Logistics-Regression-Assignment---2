    "Indication: Compare precision and recall values across different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Implication: Significant differences in precision and recall might reveal imbalances in the model's treatment of classes. For example, high precision and low recall might suggest a conservative approach, avoiding false positives at the cost of missing true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion Matrix Heatmap:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indication: Visualize the confusion matrix as a heatmap for better interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Implication: Patterns and imbalances are often more apparent in visual representations, helping to identify specific classes where the model exhibits biases or limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographic Disparities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indication: If applicable, consider demographic attributes associated with the classes and check for disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Implication: Demographic disparities in error rates may indicate biased behavior, particularly in cases where certain demographic groups are consistently misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Validation Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indication: Analyze the confusion matrix across different folds in cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Implication: Consistent biases or limitations across folds may indicate robust patterns, whereas variations may suggest sensitivity to data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Misclassified Instances:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indication: Examine individual instances that are frequently misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias Implication: Understanding why certain instances are consistently misclassified can provide insights into model limitations, potential biases, or areas where additional features may be needed."
